Problem Description:

My college course, Object-Oriented Design, provides starter files for projects and assignments as zip files with the name
"code.zip" regardless of the contents of the folder. This leads to a messy downloads directory and confusion with what zip folder contains
which files.

Solution:

The script monitors my downloads folder for zip files with the name "code.zip" and automatically moves it to my course directory
with a name that matches the content within the folder.
This greatly declutters my downloads folder and makes the process of downloading starter files a bit easier to track.
